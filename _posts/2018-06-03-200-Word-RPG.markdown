The 200 Word RPG contest ended last week and I submitted [How (And Why) I Took Over The World](https://200wordrpg.github.io/2018/rpg/2018/05/28/HowAndWhyITookOverTheWorld.html). It's a single player game where you record a series of videos as a supervillain who is journaling their plot to take over the world – heavily inspired by Dr. Horrible and also Banana Chan's [They're Onto Me](http://www.goldencobra.org/pdf/2016/TheyreOntoMe_Chan.pdf).

Avital (my wife) also submitted a game, [Spaghetti Pitch](https://200wordrpg.github.io/2018/rpg/2018/05/28/SpaghettiPitch.html). You play as startup co-founders and literally throw spaghetti at the wall to see what ideas stick – such a fun concept!

In other news, our Kickstarter for the game [CIA: Collect It All](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mmasnick/cia-collect-it-all) wrapped up with a total of $151,184 pledged by 4,476 backers – a huge success! We're incredibly happy with the results and looking forward to getting the game manufactured. If you missed the Kickstarter, you can now [place a pre-order](https://www.techdirt.com/ciagame).

Finally – Jason Morningstar and I released *Honor Bound* (our dueling game about honor culture and toxic masculinity) to our backers. Right now you can grab it by backing my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/randylubin) or his [Drip](https://d.rip/bullypulpitgames). Later this month we'll release it to the public, I'll let you know when.

If you have a chance to play any of these games, let me know!
