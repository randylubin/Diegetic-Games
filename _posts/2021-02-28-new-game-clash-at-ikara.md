I'm excited to share my latest game: [Clash at Ikara](https://storysynth.org/Games/Clash-At-Ikara/). It's a Story Synth game where you tell the story of a group of heroes defending a small community from a bandit attack.

The story is inspired by Seven Samurai and the gameplay is inspired by For the Queen.

Unlike For the Queen, this game plays out over several acts and each act has it's own deck of prompts:

1. Meeting the heroes
2. Preparing the defenses
3. Fighting the bandits
4. The aftermath

I've been meaning to play with a multi-deck take on For the Queen and this was a perfect project to test it out. I'm very happy with the final version.

If you have a chance to play it, please let me know how it goes!
