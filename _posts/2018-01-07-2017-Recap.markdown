description: A recap of Diegetic Games 2017
---

2017 was a very productive year for Diegetic Games! I'll give a quick overview of my releases, drafts, and conference attendance. Also, [launched a Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/randylubin) and would love your support in making better games! Further, I started a podcast called [Jamming on Games](jammingongames.com) and have released three episodes so far.

## Games Released

I participated in five game jams and I continue to love jams as a reason to quickly prototype and ship finished games.

In April, I wrote [Good Morning Magicland](https://diegeticgames.com/blog/2017/04/19/200-Word-RPG-Challenge.html) for the *200 Word RPG Challenge*. You put on a series of short shows on a local access TV station in a fantasy world. It's a lot of fun to play and I may return to it someday to add some extra player scaffolding and more settings.

In June I participated in Game Chef and released my first larp, [Across the Border](https://diegeticgames.com/blog/2017/07/11/Across-the-Border.html). It's about a covert border crossing and takes place walking around your neighborhood or a park. I've gotten increasingly excited about larps and expect to keep writing and playing them in 2018.

In September, I submitted another larp, [Among the Mortals](https://diegeticgames.com/blog/2017/09/23/Golden-Cobra-2017-Among-the-Mortals.html), to the Golden Cobra larpwriting competition. The game has two players peoplewatching in a public space and speculating on the fates of those around you.

In October, I submitted [GIF-Apocalypse](https://diegeticgames.com/blog/2017/10/01/2017-10-1-GIF-Apocalypse.html) to the 280 Character Game Jam and it's a silly little game played through Twitter using animated GIFs.

Finally, I created a Ghost Court / Paranoia mashup for the New Year, New Game, Game Jam. It's called [Loyalty Celebration](https://diegeticgames.com/game_files/Loyalty-Celebration.pdf) and is pretty silly.

# New Drafts and Upcoming Games

In the first few months of the year, I made significant progress on [Make Haste!](https://diegeticgames.com/game_files/Make-Haste.pdf) – a game where you draw a map as you narrate a quest. The game is in a pretty mature form and I need to make the final version of it at some point...

I also designed and tested a few games that have yet to be released as drafts.

I ran two playtests of [BART Larp](https://diegeticgames.com/blog/2017/04/16/First-BART-Larp-Playtest.html), a collaboration with Albert Kong that takes place on public transit. I have the draft of the rules half-written and hope to get it to a sharable state in the next few months.

Another larp I've been developing is Behind the Magic – a fantasy mockumentary that I brought to Metatopia. I'm extremely happy with how the game is shaping up. A current draft is available to my Patreon backers and I hope to release a final version this quarter.

I tested two other games that I'm designing through my Patreon – Duetta and Chaos is a Ladder. The former is a sandbox game with 30 minute adventures with two players that affect a persistent, shared world. The latter is a one player, one GM scheming game inspired by Littlefinger on Game of Thrones. Look for more information about both, later this year.

# Conferences

I was fortunate to attend Dreamation, Big Bad Con, and Metatopia. All three were phenomenal and I'm planning to attend all three again this year. I ran my first (non-playtest) con game at Big Bad Con and plan on running games at Dreamation and Big Bad Con this year, too. If you're heading to any of those events – come find me!

# Final Thoughts

It was a super productive year and I'm looking forward to another high-output year in 2018. I'll be sharing updates here on the blog but if you want early access to drafts and design notes – go check out my Patreon!
