Tomorrow, I'm heading up to Tahoe where I'll be spending the week in a Depth Jam, inspired by [this one from 2012](http://chrishecker.com/The_Depth_Jam). I'm going with a few other game designers and we'll each be working on our own projects in parallel. A few times per day, we'll gather together to give each other feedback.

We're hoping the change of scenery and focused schedule lead to immense productivity. I'll definitely do a write-up after, describing how we schedule our time and revealing how my projects turn out. Wish me luck!
