I'm excited to share the beta version of new game that I've designed with Sam Dunnewold. In [Three Generations: The Rise and Fall of the Eternal Empire](https://randylubin.itch.io/three-generations-eternal-empire), you’ll tell the story of the rise and fall of an empire across three eras as you build a network of cities and describe the journeys of characters who travel across its lands. Play by drawing cards from a deck, answering the questions on them, and assembling them into a map of people and places.

**Key Info:**
- Time: 60 minutes
- Player count: 1-5 players, no facilitator
- Themes: empire, exploration, trade, travel
- Designed by Randy Lubin and [Sam Dunnewold](https://sdunnewold.itch.io/)
- Inspired by [Desperation](https://bullypulpitgames.com/products/desperation) by Jason Morningstar


### Play Overview
In Three Generations: The Rise and Fall of the Eternal Empire, players collaboratively tell the story of an empire and the lands it once governed. First, players build the map by adding City and Connection cards to the board. Then, players explore the history of the empire as they draw cards that represent specific characters traveling across the land. As characters travel, they change the world; some add new locations, others add resources or abundances to the places they visit.
