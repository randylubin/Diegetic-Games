I'm excited to announce a final(ish) version of the Hackers and Hustlers RPG!

I've been learning InDesign and redesigning Hackers and Hustlers was my first project. Playing with layout and typography was a lot of fun.

I also created a [goofy micro-site](/hackers_and_hustlers_rpg) that spoofs the same generic Bootstrap theme that every startup uses. All it's missing is a feature comparison chart.

The game is free to download, share, and remix: [Hackers and Hustlers RPG](/game_files/hackers_and_hustlers_rpg.pdf)
