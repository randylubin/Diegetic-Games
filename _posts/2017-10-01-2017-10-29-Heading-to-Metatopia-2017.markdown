description: This week I'm off to Metatopia to test my fantasy mockumentary game 'Behind the Magic'
---
I'm heading to New Jersey this week for Metatopia - the top playtesting conference in the country. I had a phenomenal time last year and am very excited to bring a new game this year.

I'll be running three or four playtests of *Behind the Magic* a fantasy mockumentary that is a mix of _Lord of the Rings_ and _This is Spinal Tap_. The group roleplay a party of incompetent heroes on an epic quest which will likely fail. I've playtested it twice so far and  it's been a lot of fun!

I'm also looking forward to testing a lot of other designers games and attending some panels.

I'll post an update here on the blog once the conference is over â€“ wish me luck!
