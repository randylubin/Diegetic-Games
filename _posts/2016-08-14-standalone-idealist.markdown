I've revisited my collection [Condemned](/condemned) to break out **The Idealist** into its own file. The Idealist is the biggest game in the collection and the only storytelling game - it's about characters who sacrifice their values in exchange for power. The other two games are crazy competitions where players are running around the city, interacting with local government.

In breaking out The Idealist, I've redesigned the layout and typography. I think this will make it easier to share and play. You can download a free copy of [The Idealist](/game_files/The_Idealist.pdf) - let me know how your game goes!

I've also created a page for the entire [Condemned Collection](/condemned). This contains a bit of information about the games and the competition. I'll likely create one-off pages for most of my games.
