I love storytelling games but there aren't a ton of guides out there for people looking to get into the hobby. I've created an overview page that talks about the different types of board / card games, RPGs, and LARPs.

Check it out here: [http://diegeticgames.com/learn/](http://diegeticgames.com/learn/)

I plan to keep adding to it and creating in depth pages about the different styles of storytelling games and how to start designing games.
