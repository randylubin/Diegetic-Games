Last year I got to contribute to a great anthology of Jewish tabletop games called [Doikayt](https://metagame.itch.io/doikayt) – I highly recommend you check it out!

My submission was a chapter called "Jewish Inspirations for Worldbuilding and Adventuring" which was a collection adventure hooks, scenarios, minigames, and historical backgrounds that you can weave into your sessions or incorporate into a new game that you design.

Subsections include:

* European Jews in the Middle Ages
* Mythology and Folklore: Spirits, Golem, Monsters, and Divination
* Worldbuilding and Diaspora

You can check out the chapter on its own via this [standalone PDF](https://diegeticgames.com/uploads/jewish-inspirations-for-worldbuilding-and-adventuring.pdf) – hope you enjoy it!
