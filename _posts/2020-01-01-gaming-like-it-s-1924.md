For the second year in a row, new works are entering the public domain and so we're holding another game jam. Media published in 1924 are now free to use and remix without permission. We're excited to see what you create!

Check out [Gaming Like It's 1924](https://itch.io/jam/gaming-like-its-1924) on Itch.io for all the details – we've got great judges and prizes. There's a great summery of works to use over at Duke's [Center for the Study of the Public Domain](https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2020/).

The jam runs all of January and I'll be posting back here with the winners!
