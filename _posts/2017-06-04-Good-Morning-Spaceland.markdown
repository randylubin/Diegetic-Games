description: Good Morning Magicland update, including a new setting, Spaceland
---

[Good Morning Magicland](https://diegeticgames.com/game_files/Good-Morning-Magicland.pdf) was my submission to the 200 Word RPG Challenge. I've since playtested it a few times and it continues to be a fun, ridiculous worldbuilding game.

Earlier today, I tested it with a science fiction setting. I wasn't sure if it would work but it turned out great! The highlight may have been a new extreme sport: zero-gravity cobra throwing.

While the game works well with creative / improv types, I think it needs a little more structure for casual storytellers. Next time I play, I'll have players pick from a deck of cards that includes show and guest types.

As always, I'll post updates here. Until then, you can email me at [randy@diegeticgames.com](mailto:randy@diegeticgames.com)
