In January, I teamed up with Mike Masnick and Techdirt to run [Gaming Like It's 1923](https://itch.io/jam/gaming-like-its-1923), a game jam around new material that just entered the public domain.

We received 25 entries including a lot of fun and interesting submissions. We had an awesome team of judges help us select the winners:

* **Best Analog Game —** [**_Permanence_**](https://jackson-tegu.itch.io/permanence) **by Jackson Tegu**
* **Best Digital Game —** [**_Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening to Steal Treasure_**](https://alexblechman.itch.io/stopping-by-woods-on-a-snowy-evening-to-steal-treasure) **by Alex Blechman**
* **Best Adaptation —** [**_God of Vengeance_**](https://jrgoldb.itch.io/god-of-vengeance) **by jrgoldb**
* **Best Remix —** [**_Will You Do The Fandango?_**](https://lari-assmuth.itch.io/will-you-do-the-fandango) **by Lari Assmuth**
* **Best Deep Cut —** [**_Not a Fish_**](https://walkchewgum.itch.io/not-a-fish) **by J. Walton**
* **Best Visuals (Tie!) —** [**_Chimneys and Tulips_**](https://litrouke.itch.io/chimneysandtulips) **by litrouke, and** [**_The Garden of God_**](https://dreadroach.itch.io/the-garden-of-god) **by DreadRoach**

Go check them out as well as the other games submitted and read [Techdirt's full write-up](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190221/15205241651/announcing-winners-public-domain-game-jam.shtml) for more details on why we selected these winners.

We'll likely run this again next year for content from 1924, assuming copyright doesn't get extended again!
