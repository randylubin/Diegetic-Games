I love the direction that [Dream Askew](https://buriedwithoutceremony.com/dream-askew) took dice-less, GM-less RPGs. The distributed setting playbooks are evocative and the token economy does a good job of encouraging players to put their characters in tough situations. That said â€“ I've found myself wanting much more structure around narrative arcs and this holds true for the the broader Belonging Outside Belonging (BoB) family of games; they're great at steering decisions in the moment but there's scant scaffolding to help with overarching story.

There's an [ongoing jam](https://itch.io/jam/g2ejam) for hacks of Riley Rethal's new game [Galactic 2e](https://metagame.itch.io/galactic), which is BoB meets Star Wars. I'm using the jam as an opportunity to explore how to add more plot structure to a BoB game. My submission, which is currently in rough draft, does a few things:

1. It pares down the setting and character setup steps to a minimum
2. It has a template for creating a threat and antagonist to overcome, as well as a flaw that the players can exploit
3. It organizes scenes into a three act structure with each act in a new location
4. It has specific scene suggestions for each act

My hope is that this helps players tell a super focused story within the BoB framework. I did a quick playtest last night and, while there's tons of room for refinement, I think I'm on the right track!

You can check out the [raw work in progress](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1avgmCdHyW2E5naA7IMVyYTPhzD5nMFeu9Z3t5xeA3Ug/edit?usp=sharing) and I'm happy to hear feedback. I'll probably do at least one more rev on it and before moving to layout and polish. I'll post here when it's finished!
