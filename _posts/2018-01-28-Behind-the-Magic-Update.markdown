description: An update on Behind the Magic playtests
---

I've been working on my fantasy mockumentary Behind the Magic and last weekend it was run at the The Larp Shack International Festival of Larps in North Carolina. This was the first time it ran without me and I am always thrilled to hear about others playing my game!

I talked with three of the players afterward and it sounds like they had a lot of fun! I'm incorporating their feedback into the next draft but I think the core rules are 95% done. I'm going to start work on the high quality visual design soon and hopefully publish the final version by the end of February.

If you're going to Dreamation – this Feburary in NJ – I'll be running Behind the Magic at least once and I'd love to have you join. Let me know if you'll be there!

I'll continue to share updates here on the blog but if you want access to the  draft TODAY, you can get it through my Patreon!
