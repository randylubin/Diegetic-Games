Last week I shared some thoughts on using decks of prompts in storytelling games. I ended up creating a polished version of it in PDF form. You can grab it at: [https://randylubin.itch.io/decks-and-prompts](https://randylubin.itch.io/decks-and-prompts "https://randylubin.itch.io/decks-and-prompts")

I submitted it as part of the broader [Itch Tech Jam](https://itch.io/jam/tech-jam) which is very worth checking out!
