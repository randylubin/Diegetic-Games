Last week I gave a talk on the future of collaborative storytelling and gave examples from the cutting edge of board games, RPGs, larps, video games, virtual reality, and interactive theater.

Unfortunately, the talk wasn't recorded but I've compiled a list of all my [collaborative storytelling examples](/learn/collaborative-storytelling-examples).

I'll try to keep updating the list and hope to record the talk itself at some point. Until then, you can always email me at [randy@diegeticgames.com](mailto:randy@diegeticgames.com)
