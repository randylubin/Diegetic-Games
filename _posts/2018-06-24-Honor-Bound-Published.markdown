Last month, Jason Morningstar and I released *Honor Bound* to our Patreon and Drip backers. It's now available for purchase by the general public. [Buy the PDF today on Itch.io!](https://randylubin.itch.io/honor-bound).

Here's the quick pitch:

>Honor Bound explores honor culture and masculinity through the lens of an old fashioned duel. Play starts just after a challenge is issued and follows the duelists, seconds, doctor, and judge as they struggle to de-escalate a fraught situation in a society that values reputation above all else.
>
>The game takes roughly two hours to play. It starts with a workshop that will get you up to speed on the setting and themes of the game; you'll also establish the incident that triggered the duel. Once play begins, you'll be struggling to de-escalate the situation even as the characters negotiate the final details of weapons, ground, and range.

We're donating all the profits to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) which works to protect civil liberties in the digital world.

If you have a chance to play it, let me know!
