Here's a quick preview of an upcoming [Story Synth](storysynth.org) format called Generator.

This format aims to take the ease of designing Story Synth games in Google Sheets and apply it to storytelling game generators. Generators are tools that let you create multiple lists of prompts and randomly grab one prompt from each list. [Perchance](https://perchance.org/welcome) is probably the most popular generator site at the moment and [DNGNGEN](https://dngngen.makedatanotlore.dev/) is probably the high water mark for visual design for a one-off game generator.

The Story Synth generator will be purely powered by Google Sheets an allow designers to specify row layouts, color schemes (from templates or custom) and much more. It'll also be realtime multiplayer, unlike the competition.

I'm collaborating with [Raph D'Amico](http://www.raphdamico.com/) on this project and he'll be spicing up the visual design. We hope to release it in the next week or two â€“ stay tuned!
