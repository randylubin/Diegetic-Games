As work on Behind the Magic continues, I'm excited to share that I'll be running a variant of it at [Big Bad Con](https://www.bigbadcon.com/) this October. Big Bad Con is a phenomenal convention in the Bay Area, full of indie storytelling games. This year it's October 11-14th.

I'll be adapting Behind the Magic to run with an audience. I'll probably add an audience facilitator role and have a dedicated Bard. The audience will help shape the quest goal, characters, locations, and ultimate success. Hopefully they'll be other fun ways I can involve the audience â€“ maybe as guest NPCs?

This is all super early stage but I look forward to sharing more details as it gets closer!
