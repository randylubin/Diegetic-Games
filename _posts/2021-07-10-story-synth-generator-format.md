The Generator format for Story Synth is now live and it looks great!

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;"><iframe src="[https://www.loom.com/embed/2d813a53f3a649dcba72edf999fc298f](https://www.loom.com/embed/2d813a53f3a649dcba72edf999fc298f "https://www.loom.com/embed/2d813a53f3a649dcba72edf999fc298f")" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

This format is a collaboration with Raph D'Amico and he did an outstanding job on developing a handful of style templates: light, dark, cyberpunk, fantasy, and vaporwave. I'll be adding these styles to other formats soon to make custom design that much easier!

The Generator format is inspired by generators like [Perchance](https://perchance.org/welcome) and, like all Story Synth formats, has realtime multiplayer built in and it doesn't require any coding (just add your content to a Google Sheet).

I'm excited to see folks start developing with this format – let me know if you need any help or have any feature requests!
