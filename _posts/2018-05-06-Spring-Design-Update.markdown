I have a big [update post on my Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/posts/update-so-many-18489316) covering what I've been working on. Main topics include:

* Overview of **Honor Bound**, a new freeform game I'm designing with Jason Morningstar
* Info on the CIA Game I'm [currently Kickstarting](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mmasnick/cia-collect-it-all/) (at 225% funded right now!)
* Early sketches of illustrations for **Behind the Magic**

[Check out the post](https://www.patreon.com/posts/update-so-many-18489316) for more details.
