I'm excited to share a new game that my brother [Greg Lubin](https://twitter.com/gslubin) and I just released: [Æethelred's Acadmey for Aspiring Heroes](https://storysynth.org/Games/Aethelreds-Academy/)

Æthelred’s is a for-profit, non-accredited institution and players tell stilly stories about heroes going on quests in an attempt to earn certifications in specific adventuring skills.

The quest giver, quests, and certifications are all randomly generated, leading to adventures like: The Corrupt Mayor tasked you with Securing a Strategic Alliance and you must use this quest to demonstrate your skill in Interior Decorating.

We've had a lot of fun designing and playtesting it and we'd love to hear if you play it! Here's the link again: [https://storysynth.org/Games/Aethelreds-Academy/](https://storysynth.org/Games/Aethelreds-Academy/ "https://storysynth.org/Games/Aethelreds-Academy/")
