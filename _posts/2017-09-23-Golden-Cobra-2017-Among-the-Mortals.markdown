I'm excited to share my submission for the Golden Cobra 2017: [Among the Mortals](/game_files/Among-the-Mortals.pdf)

You and a friend will play ancient rivals, engaging in a proxy war for the fate of humanity. The game is played in a public space and you will take turns describing the mortals and controlling their destinies.

Let me know if you have a chance to play it!
