I'm in the fun yet frustrating position of having too many game ideas and not enough time! I'm currently working on four different games and I just came up with a new one I'm really excited about. I won't actually start work on it for a while but here's the pitch:

A real life game or interactive theater experience where the player is trying to socially engineer an actor. Another pitch is that it's like an escape room game where you aren't solving classic puzzles but figuring out what to say to accomplish your goal. I imagine that it'd be pretty easy to say the wrong thing the first time through and have the game end, then the entire scenario would restart and the actor wouldn't recognize you. It might take several loops to get the right clues to say the right things to achieve the goal.

Anyhow, hopefully I'll get to it at some point in the future!

I'll post back here with any new updates to these games and more. Until then, you can always email me at [randy@diegeticgames.com](mailto:randy@diegeticgames.com)
