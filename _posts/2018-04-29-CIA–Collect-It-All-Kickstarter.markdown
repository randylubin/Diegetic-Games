Diegetic Games has partnered with [Techdirt](https://www.techdirt.com/) to Kickstart a game! It's called CIA: Collect It All and the [Kickstarter page](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mmasnick/cia-collect-it-all/) has tons more details. We fully funded in just two days and are currently near 150% of our goal.

The game is based on a recently declassified CIA training game called Collection: Deck. They use it to train their analysts and officers on the different types of information collection techniques. The files were released to the public through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request and you can see the originals on [Muckrock](https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2017/dec/06/cia-card-game/).

It's a competitive card game where players combine information tactics to combat international crises. I'll also be designing a storytelling variant that uses the same cards.

Stay tuned for more details or [back it on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mmasnick/cia-collect-it-all/) for all of the updates!
