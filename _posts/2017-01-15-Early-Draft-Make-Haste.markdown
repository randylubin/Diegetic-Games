Over the past month I've been working on a new map-making game, tentatively called **Make Haste!**

The game is inspired by a Jason Morningstar and Tim Hutchings talk at Metatopia – they shared amazing artifacts players had created for games. I wanted to create a game that yields great artifacts.

In **Make Haste!**, Players collaboratively build a map and tell the story of a group journeying across it. It works with lots of genres ranging from high fantasy (e.g. Lord of the Rings), to science fiction, to zombie survival.

I've playtested it five times so far and the rules are approaching a local maxima. The game creates great maps with fun stories and I'm happy with how it's shaping up. Next up, I'll test some big changes to the rules to see if it makes the game more fun / interesting.

If you're interested in playtesting, download the [current draft](https://diegeticgames.com/game_files/Make-Haste.pdf). I'd love to hear feedback, you can email me at [randy@diegeticgames.com](mailto:randy@diegeticgames.com)

Here are some photos from recent games:
