description: I've just launched a Patreon to support my game design efforts
---

I'm excited to announce that I've [launched a Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/randylubin). Come support me and be a part of my game design process!

## Why Patreon?

Patreon is a platform where fans can support artists by making pledges. In my case, I'll be releasing games every three months and you can pledge as little as $1 per game – even that helps!

I'm excited to bring my backers into the design process – getting feedback on early designs and getting suggestions for which games to design next. If you pledge, you'll also get access to early design drafts and posts about my design process.

The Patreon is off to a great start and it's already over $100 per game. If it reaches $250 per game, I'll start commissioning art. Come join the Patreon – I'd love to have your backing!
