I had a phenomenal time at Metatopia this year! It was so great to catch up with old friends, meet internet friends in person, and discover great new designers.

I'm hoping to be back east for Dreamation but February feels so far away!

My own tests – for Behind the Magic – were extremely helpful and I'm very happy with how the rules are shaping up. I tested the game three times and all three yielded the silly fun I wanted! The games were full of bumbling wizards, jaded barbarians, amoral nobles and other inept adventurers – not once did our heroes save the day :)

I'll be revising the rules based on the feedback and hope to share a playable draft in the next few weeks!
