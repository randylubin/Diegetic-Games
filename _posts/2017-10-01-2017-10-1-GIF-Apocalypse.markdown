description: GIF Apocalypse is my submission to the 280 Character Game Jam on Twitter
---

This week, Twitter expanded their tweet length to 280 characters and [@cartwheel](https://twitter.com/cartweel) launched a 280 character game jam.

My submission is a game meant to be played on Twitter purely using animated GIFs. Here are the rules:


*GIF-Apocalypse*

Decades after the apocalypse, literacy is gone but Twitter remains

All chat is w/ GIFs, no text

Each player has a resource the other needs

Can you establish enough trust to meet IRL and trade goods, thus ensuring survival?
