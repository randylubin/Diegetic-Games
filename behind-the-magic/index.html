      <p>In <b>Behind the Magic</b>, youâ€™ll create a fantasy mockumentary by playing a group of incompetent adventurers on a quest to save the world. Players will take turns setting and acting out scenes and also have "confessionals" with the Bard who is documenting their journey.</p>

      <p>Key Facts</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Players: 4-7, no facilitator needed</li>
        <li>Time: 2-3 Hours</li>
        <li>Preparation: none, though one player should be familiar with the rules</li>
        <li>Location: A single large space where players can move around and act out scenes</li>
        <li>Materials needed: A printed copy of the rules, at least one chair, nametags (optional)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The game starts with ~30 minutes of setup where you select a quest, build the setting, and create your characters. Then you'll spend 60 - 90 minutes playing out the adventure and seeing if the heroes succeed... or at least don't make things worse.</p>

      <p>The rules are written for embodied play, walking around the room in character. However, there are variant rules for playing it at a table. The game has been playtested thoroughly with beginner and advanced storytellers and works well for players of all skill levels.</p>
