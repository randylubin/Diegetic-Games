      <h1>About Condmened</h1>
      <p>
        Condemned is a collection of three games created for <a href="https://medium.com/@timhwang/the-power-broker-a-game-design-competition-5eb4ff1f8146#.hsi0oze5k">The Power Broker Game Design Competition.</a> The goal was to create games that adapt or interperate Robert Caro's biography of Robert Moses, <a href="http://amzn.to/2acLoqL">The Power Broker</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I created three games, <strong>The Idealist</strong>, <strong>The Rise to Power</strong>, and <strong>The Use of Power</strong>. The first is a storytelling game about the corruption of idealism. The second and third are games that have players engaging with actual city infrastructure and bureaucracies. You can download a <a href="/game_files/Condemned.pdf">free pdf of the collection</a> or just the rules for <a href="/game_files/The_Idealist.pdf">The Idealist</a>.

        <h1>The Idealist</h1>
        <p>
          Robert Moses began his career a strident idealist but became a machiavellian bully who abused his power for petty and egotistical ends. The Idealist explores characters who follow a similar arc: abandoning their strongest values and embracing corruption in the pursuit of power.
        </p>
        <p>
          The players will jointly create a setting and then individually create characters. Over the course of the game, players will describe scenes in which their characters betray their values in exchange for increasing power and influence.

        <h1>The Rise to Power</h1>
        <p>
          When Robert Moses went to Albany, he gained a deep understanding
          for the workings of the legislature and a comprehensive knowledge
          of New York State law. He leveraged this mastery to amass and
          consolidate power when Al Smith won the governorship.
        </p>
        <p>
          In The Rise to Power, players engage with local governments by
          getting appointments to municipal boards and commissions in their
          city.

        <h1>The Use of Power</h1>
        <p>
          Robert Moses knew how to manipulate laws, bureaucracies, and
          public opinion to achieve his goals. While Moses built massive parks,
          bridges, highways, and other public works, The Use of Power tasks
          players racing to change the name of a street in their city.
