      <h1>Across the Border</h1>
      <p><i>Youâ€™ve never been closer to the border, or closer to getting caught. Tonight you will dodge patrols and natural perils as you try to cross over. With the help of a local guide, and a lot of luck, your journey might be successful.</i></p>

      <p>This is a game about covertly crossing a border. One player will be the local guide and the rest will be characters trying to reach the other side. You play it while going for a hike, ideally in nature, but you can also play it on city streets. The local guide should read these rules in advance and print out the conversation cards.</p>

      <p><strong>Players</strong>: One local guide to facilitate and 3 to 10 border crossers
      <br /><strong>Material</strong>: Yarn, scissors, printed Conversation Cards
      <br /><strong>Length</strong>: 45 to 90 minutes</p>
