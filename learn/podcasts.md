# RPG and Game Design Podcasts

Whether you're interested in playing games or designing them, there's a wealth of podcasts about the hobby. Here are some I recommend:

## Actual Plays

*   [One Shot Podcast](http://oneshotpodcast.com/category/podcasts/one-shot/): they have a well over a hundred recorded episodes featuring a diverse array of systems. The GM is very talented and the players are skilled improv'ers. This is a great way to check out systems.
*   [Film Reroll](http://www.filmreroll.com/): Comedians take a movie and start playing it as an RPG - inevitably goes off the rails in amazing ways

## RPG Musing, Tip, and Analysis

*   [Critical Success](http://oneshotpodcast.com/category/podcasts/critical-success/): By the same guy as One Shot, this is full of great GM tips
*   [Narrative Control](http://narrativecontrol.libsyn.com/): A thoughtful series discussing RPGs and GM techniques
*   [The Tabletop Superhighway](https://thetabletopsuperhighway.com/): A good crew of gamers and designers talking about different aspects of play and techniques for better sessions

## Game Design

*   [Design Games](http://designgamespodcast.tumblr.com/): Two seasoned RPG designers talking in depth about their craft
*   [Modifier](http://oneshotpodcast.com/category/podcasts/modifier/): Looks at hacking and modifying existing games (which is a form of game design)
*   [Backstory](http://oneshotpodcast.com/category/podcasts/backstory/): Interesting interviews with Game Designers

## Other

*   [CoolGames Inc](https://soundcloud.com/coolgamesinc): Great improv comedy where two game critics design a new game on the spot
