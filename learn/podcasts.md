# RPG and Game Design Podcasts

Whether you're interested in playing games or designing them, there's a wealth of podcasts about the hobby. Here are some I recommend:

## Actual Plays

* [One Shot Podcast](http://oneshotpodcast.com/category/podcasts/one-shot/): they have a well over a hundred recorded episodes featuring a diverse array of systems. The GM is very talented and the players are skilled improv'ers. This is a great way to check out systems.
* [Party of One](https://www.partyofonepodcast.com/): a ton of short one-shots featuring just two players. A great way to get a quick sense of a system!

## Game Design

* [Design Games](http://designgamespodcast.tumblr.com/): Two seasoned RPG designers talking in depth about their craft
* [Draw Your Dice](https://redcircle.com/shows/draw-your-dice-podcast): great in-depth interviews with designers, discussing their design approach and philosophy
* [Brain Trust](): a great game design discussion podcast with lots of on-air designing
* [Stop, Hack, and Roll](https://stop-hack-and-roll-podcast.pinecast.co/): a great podcast featuring free-wheeling game design discussion
* [Modifier](http://oneshotpodcast.com/category/podcasts/modifier/): Looks at hacking and modifying existing games (which is a form of game design)
* [Backstory](http://oneshotpodcast.com/category/podcasts/backstory/): Interesting interviews with Game Designers
