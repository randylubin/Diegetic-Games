I've had two interviews released in the past couple days, both on the subjects of games and game design.

The first was a podcast interview on Draw Your Dice, a wonderful series in which host Jeremy Gage interviews different game designers and does deep dives on their games. I loved chatting with Jeremy and we talked in depth about stage gate design, Behind the Magic, Premise, and Story Synth. Check it out: [Draw Your Dice: Randy Lubin](https://redcircle.com/shows/draw-your-dice-podcast/episodes/9ddb0dc9-f5f6-4cfc-b4c8-2086d2ac0753).

The second was on the Plus One Exp stream, in conversation with Tony Vasinda. We talk about Serious Games, including the recent Money City game from MozFest, and we talk about Story Synth and much more. Check it out on YouTube: [Prestige Class with Randy Lubin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taSOkBdDT5w)

Both of these were fun to record and both Jeremy and Tony were fantastic hosts. I'd love to hop on more shows and talk about game design so if you're interested in having me on, reach out!
