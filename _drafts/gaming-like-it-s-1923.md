2019 is the first year that new works are entering the public domain since 1998. Anything published in 1923 is now free to remix and share. To celebrate, we've teamed up with Mike Masnick and Techdirt to host a game jam based on works from 1923.

Submissions are open through the end of January and we'll be picking winners in early February. We're awarding prizes in multiple categories and have a phenomenal array of judges.

You can find info on prizes, judges, and more on the game jam page: [https://itch.io/jam/gaming-like-its-1923](https://itch.io/jam/gaming-like-its-1923 "Gaming Like It's 1923").

Looking forward to reading the submissions!
