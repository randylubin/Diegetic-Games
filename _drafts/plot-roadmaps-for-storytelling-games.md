## A Love of Plot

When it comes to storytelling games, I love to weave fast paced plots that reach satisfying conclusions. This is especially true for single-session games where it can be fun to race through key story beats and wrap things up neatly by the end of play.

I've found that many games out there have phenomenal support for character creation and arcs, worldbuilding, and individual story beats yet have little to say when it comes to overarching plot.

A quick caveat – there's no wrong way to play! I've played in wonderful sessions that were just focused on worldbuilding or character creation or exploring how characters interact with each other. That said, my personal preference is often for a strong narrative arc with a clear resolution and I often find this type of play unsupported.

When there's a lack of plot support, there's a risk that the story will meander and players won't be sure exactly how to push the story forward. Sessions might end with the story just petering out. This is especially true for novice players who might also be focused on learning the rules.

## Introducing Plot Roadmaps

I'd love to see a new category of game supplements: Plot Roadmaps. These Roadmaps would guide players through a single session of the base game that hits specific narrative beats.

Ideally these Roadmaps would include:

* A Script: short instructions that could be read aloud during play, which walk players through all the necessary steps of character creation and play.
* Scene lists: a series of scene prompts and narrative beats which the players can skim through – some might be optional and some mandatory.

## Example: Save the Galaxy

I've just released my first Plot Roadmap, called [Save The Galaxy](https://randylubin.itch.io/save-the-galaxy). It's a supplement for Riley Rethal's game [Galactic 2e](https://metagame.itch.io/galactic). Save the Galaxy guides the players through telling a tightly plotted one shot where a group of heroes foil a dastardly plot by The Mandate (an analog to The Empire in Star Wars).

Galactic 2e is a Belonging Outside Belonging (BoB) game that is heavily inspired by Star Wars. Like other BoB games, there's no facilitator or dice rolling. Players share responsibility for representing the different elements of the setting in play, as well as the actions of the non-player characters.

Galactic does a great job of supporting character creation and character arcs, through evocative character sheets and moves (actions). However, there isn't direct support for telling tightly plotted single-session stories – and that's not the game's intention.

With Save the Galaxy, my aim is to help any group of players take the strong character sheets and setting pillars from the Galactic Playkit and quickly tell a story with a strong narrative arc.

TK Similarity with quick starts

TK Games that do plot structure well - Fiasco with everything falling apart, The Zone with characters dying and one player reaching the center, For the Queen with the final card bringing the journey to a climax. Indigo Galleon with clocks. Behind the Magic has scenes for each Act of the story. Larp in general!
