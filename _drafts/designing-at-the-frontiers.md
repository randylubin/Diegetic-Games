Recently I've been thinking about the frontiers of design in storytelling games. What are the most interesting facets of play to engage with as a designer? Where can we push the medium the most?

Here is an initial pass at a list of the areas that I think are most fruitful to focus on:

## Digital / Analog Hybrid

Games that are played in person, whether at a table or embodied, that are assisted by an app. I haven't seen many apps involved in storytelling games, with the exception of character creation tools, dice rolling functions, and simple wikis.

Apps can provide the following benefits:

* Tracking a complicated state of the world or directory of locations and  NPCs
* Maintaining a simulation of the world that enables interesting emergence in response to player actions
* Making complicated resolution systems easy through automation
* Sharing secrets with and among players
* Assisting with narrative generation / coming up with story options

Apps might be able to replace many of the traditional functions of a GM, the key question is when it is most interesting for that to happen.

It's never been easier to code up simple web apps with real time data structures. I suspect we'll start seeing game designers who have a little coding chops start experimenting with app driven in-person games.

## Open Table / Pervasive

Scheduling is hard and it isn't always realistic to get the same group together for a weekly campaign. One solution is an 'open table' style game where a larger pool of players (say 10-20) have characters but only a subset (4-6) show up to a given session. This style play has been around since at least the early 2000s with [The West Marches](http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/78/grand-experiments-west-marches/) being the earliest form I've heard about.

Some of the unique problems with open table are keeping all players updated on the state of the story, world, and characters. If you're playing a game with character advancement (leveling up) then a session should work well even if it's one player's first session and another player's 20th. Another tradeoff is that it's hard for a GM (if there is one) to focus on any specific character's arc and their relationships with NPCs; likewise the relationships between player characters might not have much room to evolve.

There's room for a wave of games that are designed from the beginning to be open table. They'll have built in solutions to the above problems and likely other interesting affordances. For example, there might be a way to have quick games with any subset of participants. If two players find themselves hanging out randomly after work they could run a quick session and have it naturally plug into the broader campaign.

## Story APIs

Building on some of the Open Table affordances, Story APIs is a philosophy of building storytelling games that allow for a wide variety of play types within an ongoing world or campaign.

API (Application Programing Interface) is a term from the software world that covers easy ways that different bits of code can talk to each other and share information. Good APIs allow critical information to pass back and forth between different apps without either app having to know much about how the other works.

A framework of Story APIs would allow players to play one campaign with  multiple systems, with an option to change the system each session based on what type of play they want to engage in. The API part would make it easy to convert relevant stats from one system to another – and back. If a group is playing with experience points, harm, or other key stats, there should be a way of carrying that over across systems.

One way this might work in a fantasy campaign is using Dungeon World as a default but transitioning to D&D for boss battles and even a wargame for large army combat.

If there is a core building block of play, like a quest or a heist, then there could be a general set of probabilities around outcomes and then a way of translating that into any other system. For example, it could be that quests have a 20% chance of failing interestingly, 50% chance of succeeding at a cost and 30% chance of ending with a resounding success. There would be guidance in translating those odds to combat ratings in D&D, a number of hard moves in Dungeon World, and a clear way to enable designers to quickly make up their own resolution systems that play well with the core system.

## Digital First

Over the past few years, there's been a huge rise in online play. Whether streamed for an audience through Twitch or just with friends over Hangouts or Role 20 – many players are adapting analog games to digital tools.

There's definitely room for games that are designed to played
