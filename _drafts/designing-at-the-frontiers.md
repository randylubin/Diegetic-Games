Recently I've been thinking about the frontiers of design in storytelling games. What are the most interesting facets of play to be engaging with as a designer? Where can I push the medium the most?

Here is an initial pass at a list of the areas that I think are most fruitful for designers to be tinkering:

## Digital / Analog Hybrid

Games that are played in person, whether at a table or embodied, that are assisted by an app. I haven't seen many apps involved in storytelling games, with the exception of character creation tools, dice rolling functions, and simple wikis.

Apps can provide the following benefits:

* Tracking a complicated state of the world or directory of locations and  NPCs
* Maintaining a simulation of the world that enables interesting emergence in response to player actions
* Making complicated resolution systems easy through automation
* Sharing secrets with and among players
* Assisting with narrative generation / coming up with story options

Apps might be able to replace many of the traditional functions of a GM, the key question is when it is most interesting for that to happen.

It's never been easier to code up simple web apps with real time data structures. I suspect we'll start seeing game designers who have a little coding chops start experimenting with app driven in-person games.
