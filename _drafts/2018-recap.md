Wow what a year!

I launched my Patreon at the end of 2017 and my initial goal was to ship 4 games this year. I ended up getting massively side tracked but for interesting reasons and still had a high design output, just not how I intended!

I started 2018 by iterating on Behind the Magic, my fantasy mockumentary game. The core game was great but I was experimenting with how to present the rules and trying out variant ways to play.

I decided to commission illustrations and knew that Meg Dornbrock's style was perfect for my incompetent adventurers. She did a phenomenal job and it was a joy to work with her. Check out these results:
