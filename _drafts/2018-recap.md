Wow what a year!

I launched my Patreon at the end of 2017 and my initial goal was to ship 4 games this year. I ended up getting massively side tracked but for interesting reasons and still had a high design output, just not how I intended!

# Patreon Releases

I started 2018 by iterating on Behind the Magic, my fantasy mockumentary game. The core game was great but I was experimenting with how to present the rules and trying out variant ways to play.

I decided to commission illustrations and knew that Meg Dornbrock's style was perfect for my incompetent adventurers. She did a phenomenal job and it was a joy to work with her. Check out these results:

Honor Bound came together over a couple hours of focused design work while we were hanging out in San Francisco. It examines toxic masculinity and honor culture through the lens of an old fashioned duel. Jason was a pleasure to collaborate with and I'm extremely proud of how the game turned out.

You can [grab a copy here](https://randylubin.itch.io/honor-bound) for $8 and we'll donate all profits to the EFF. We've heard great feedback from players and it was even mentioned on the Imaginary World podcast!
