In 2018, Jason Morningstar and I designed and released [Honor Bound](https://randylubin.itch.io/honor-bound) – a game about how honor culture and toxic masculinity make it nearly impossible to deescalate from a fraught situation.

I'm incredibly proud of this game for multiple reasons:

* It effectively conveys the dynamics of honor culture and toxic masculinity
* It reliably creates charged, dramatic situation
* The structuring and design of the rules and handouts are easy to parse and use, even by novice players and facilitators
* It provides strong character and world scaffolding to help participants play their characters
* It has as satisfying arc of play in just two hours

In this post, I'll walk through some of the specific design decisions we made and how they work to support our goals for the game.
