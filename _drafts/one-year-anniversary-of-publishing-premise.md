Roughly a year ago I published [Premise: Setting, Character, Plot](https://randylubin.itch.io/premise-setting-character-plot) which you can now buy via Itch.io. I did very little promotion of it back then and didn't write about it on this blog (blame the pandemic) so here's a bit about it.

## About the Game

Premise is a light collaborative worldbuilding game inspired by Exquisite Corpse and Mad Libs. 2-7 players simultaneously fill out and pass around templates and build on each others ideas. When the templates are complete, you take turns sharing the results.

It's very beginner friendly and is fun for kids and adults. You can play it in 30-90 minutes and easily integrate it into another storytelling game (e.g. play the Setting section to build out a map, play the Character setting to create NPCs).

In addition to a print-at-home PDF, the game also has Google Slides for easy Remote play. I actually used it recently as part of a sci-fi writing workshop!

A bit of backstory: I first playtested Premise back in May 2016 and then I brought it to my first Metatopia. I then deprioritized it as I dove into other design ideas and a deep dive into larp but it was fun returning to it years later to polish it up.

I'm happy to have Premise out there in the world and hope it gets a bunch more play! Let me know if
