Despite the mess that was 2020, I was fairly productive on the game design front. Here's a quick overview of the year's releases and activities.

## Premise: Setting, Character, Plot

Premise is a trio of collaborative storytelling games focused on Setting, Character, and Plot – and you can play them independently or chain them together to explore a world in depth. Each sub-game has it's own template and play consists of simultaneously filling out parts of the templates, passing the sheets, and building on each other's ideas.

I started working on Premise ages ago but it was frequently pushed to the backburner as I worked on more urgent projects. I published it in February and I'm very happy with how the final version turned out! I ended up doing very little marketing or promotion for Premise (a frequent problem for Diegetic Games) so I might give it another push this year.

You can [buy Premise on Itch.io](https://randylubin.itch.io/premise-setting-character-plot) – there's a print-at-home version as well as templates to play online via Google Slides.

## Leveraged Play / Serious Games

I was also busy on the "serious games" front. Last year I designed and ran:

* Imagining Health Futures, a game that explores the future of health, in support of UNICEF's Office of Innovation (co-designed with Jason Morningstar) (facilitator guide)
* Threatcast 2020, a game about election manipulation (co-designed with Copia) (write-up)
* Hindsight 2030, a game about exploring trends over the next 10 years (co-designed with Copia) ([Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/randylubin/status/1299135869803085826))
* Positive AI Economic Futures, a 4-hour workshop involving 5 mini-games designed for the World Economic Forum and the Center for Human-compatible Artificial Intelligence (co-designed with Copia)
