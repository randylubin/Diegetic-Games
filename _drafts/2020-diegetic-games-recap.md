Despite the mess that was 2020, I was fairly productive on the game design front. I published a total of 8 games as well as an online game design platform! Here's a quick overview of the year's releases and activities.

## Premise: Setting, Character, Plot

Premise is a trio of collaborative storytelling games focused on Setting, Character, and Plot – and you can play them independently or chain them together to explore a world in depth. Each sub-game has it's own template and play consists of simultaneously filling out parts of the templates, passing the sheets, and building on each other's ideas.

I started working on Premise ages ago but it was frequently pushed to the backburner as I worked on more urgent projects. I published it in February and I'm very happy with how the final version turned out! I ended up doing very little marketing or promotion for Premise (a frequent problem for Diegetic Games) so I might give it another push this year.

You can [buy Premise on Itch.io](https://randylubin.itch.io/premise-setting-character-plot) – there's a print-at-home version as well as templates to play online via Google Slides.

## Dawn of the Monster Invasion

In September, I released Dawn of the Monster Invasion, a game where players create a spoof of monster movies though a series of speeches + Q&A. It was my submission to Golden Cobra and it won an award! I create a web app so folks could play over video chat and then extended the app to be a platform any designer could use – more on that in a moment. The game + app platform won the award for "Best New Tool" which was nice honor.

You can read more about the game [in this post](https://diegeticgames.com/blog/2020/09/21/dawn-of-the-monster-invasion-my-golden-cobra-2020-submission.html) and you can [play it online here](http://monster.diegeticgames.com/).

## Story Synth

In October, I launched [Story Synth](http://storysynth.org/) as a web platform that helps designers quickly create and share prompt-driven storytelling games. Designing is as easy as adding card content to a Google Sheet and then pasting that sheet into the website. From there, you can create new game sessions and share them with friends and playtesters online.

Story Synth supports a handful of game formats. The most popular allows randomly drawing prompts from a deck (or decks), which is great for games inspired by For the Queen or The Quiet Year. Other formats support timer-based prompts, random prompt generation, phased based play, and more.

I'm continuing to evolve the platform and am loving the development process. There are already a handful of designers creating games on the platform and I'm hoping to see plenty more games on it soon!

You can learn more about creating games via the [documentation pages](https://docs.storysynth.org/guide/#overview) but please reach out if you have any questions!

## Around the Realm

In December I released Around the Realm, a light storytelling game where players create the story of two companions racing around a fantasy realm. It's inspired by Jules Verne's Around the World in 80 Days and generates quick, fun adventures. You can [play it online here](http://storysynth.org/Games/Around-The-Realm) (via Story Synth).

## Post-Work Paradise

In December, I also designed a submission for the [Post-Work City Project](https://postwork.city/) called [Post-Work Paradise](http://storysynth.org/games/Post-Work-City). In Post-work Paradise, you see randomly generated residents of a city, in a world where automation has rendered traditional work unnecessary. Players take turns answering questions about these generated citizens and their lives.

I was honored to hear that my submission was one of seven that were accepted to be featured in the Post-Work City gallery. I also participated in a panel where I got to talk about the game and my design choices.

## Leveraged Play / Serious Games

I was also busy on the "serious games" front. Last year I designed and ran:

* Imagining Health Futures, a game that explores the future of health, in support of UNICEF's Office of Innovation (co-designed with Jason Morningstar) ([facilitator guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZWTMnG3gqjG2R2Mc95uodPoNo-GnNR5V/view?usp=sharing))
* Threatcast 2020, a game about election manipulation (co-designed with Copia) ([Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/randylubin/status/1299135869803085826))
* Hindsight 2030, a game about exploring trends over the next 10 years (co-designed with Copia) ([write-up](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20201130/10074645790/copia-gaming-hour-experiment-getting-together-virtually-to-play-with-future.shtml))
* Positive AI Economic Futures, a 4-hour workshop involving 5 mini-games designed for the World Economic Forum and the Center for Human-compatible Artificial Intelligence (co-designed with Copia) ([write-up](https://blog.randylubin.com/positive-ai-economic-futures-workshop))

## 2021

I'm not positive what 2021 will have in store. I anticipate spending a lot of time on Story Synth – adding new features and making example games.

I'd also love to publish my map making game 'Make Haste' but we'll see how I prioritize it.

I'll likely also be busy with plenty of interesting "serious games" and will share those details, too.
